<h3> ALIENS </h3>
<p> I really love this Sci-fi Movie. Badass female lead </p>

<h3> Train To Busan </h3>
<p> Zombies, with a bit of comedy, and some great relationship development</p>

<h3> Shrek 2 </h3>
<p> Out off all the films, Shrek 2 is simple the better one.Great actors, and many a giggle </p>
